# Dappnode Package SSV Holesky Testnet "Jato" V3

This package allows Dappnode Users to help test the SSV Network. A pioneer in the field of DVT (Decentralized Validator Technology), SSV is a network of validators that use a decentralized network of operators to run their validators. This package allows you to run an SSV Operator Node on the SSV Testnet "Jato" V3.

_Warning: This package has been modified for the Jato-V2 Testnet, which will be restarted in Mid-September 2023. SSV Jato-v1 Operators must upgrade to this version of the package or higher in order to continue operating on the network._

## Generate Operator Keys

**DO NOT** Reuse keys from the V1 "Primus" Testnet or V2 "Shifu"; You need to create new keys and register them [here](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) or [https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register](https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) **before September 18, 2023**.

You'll need a keypair in order to run an operator on SSV. It will be automatically generated for you when you install this package. However, you can also restore an existing keypair if you have one by uploading a backup file.

## Operator Registration

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate validators with SSV. This is done in the Web App linked below.

Register your new operator (**DO NOT REUSE OPERATORS FROM THE V1 "Primus" TESTNET or V2 "Shifu"**) using this [Web App](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) or [https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register](https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) **before September 18, 2023**.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/registration) to register your operator.
After registration, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and SSV stakers can choose you as one of their validator's operators.
