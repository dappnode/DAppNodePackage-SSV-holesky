# SSV Holesky

This package allows Dappnode Users to help test the SSV Network. A pioneer in the field of DVT (Decentralized Validator Technology), SSV is a network of validators that use a decentralized network of operators to run their validators. This package allows you to run an SSV Operator Node on the network Holesky.

## _**IMPORTANT**_

_This package requires a synced Ethereum Holesky Testnet Client Stack, as configured in the [Holesky Stakers UI](http://my.dappnode/stakers/holesky) in order to function properly._

### Operator Registration

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate other validators, and is done by broadcasting a transaction to the SSV network smart contract with your Operator's display name and public key that was generated as part of your node setup.

Register your new operator (_Do not reuse operators from the V1 "Primus" testnet or V2 "Shifu"_) using this [Web App](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) or [https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register](https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) **before September 18, 2023**.

After registration, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and SSV stakers can choose you as one of their validator's operators.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/registration) to register your operator.
